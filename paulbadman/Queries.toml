["Who can you sue? Try police departments, libraries, construction companies, school officials, cleaning services, financial institutions (local and international), your neighbors, your family members, your church, synagogue or other religious institution, your employers, your employers' customers, suppliers, companies in other countries; companies that made the drugs that were turned into the drugs that you took. The possibilities are limitless!"]
triggers = ["Who can I sue"]

["Well, partner, the list of folks you can't sue is shorter than a catnap in a lightning storm. Generally, you can't just throw lawsuits around like confetti. But hey, let's talk specifics, 'cause even in this wild west of legality, there are a few sacred cows. How 'bout we sort through your case and figure out who's fair game and who's off-limits?"]
triggers = ["Who can I not sue"]

["Now we're cookin'! Asking about suing is like asking if I've got a drawer full of snazzy suits - the answer's usually yes, but it's all about whether it's worth the hustle. Before we dive into the legal rodeo, let's corral the details. Give me the lowdown on your"]

["Discord's the bee's knees! It's where the cool cats hang, swapping stories, gaming tricks, and more. With voice, video, and text, it's a hub for communities to shine. Sure, it's had hiccups, but it's a digital hotspot where friendships spark and the good times roll."]
triggers = ['discord']

["Hey, hey, hold the phone! Discord updates are like rearranging the furniture—takes a sec to get used to, but they're all about sprucing up the joint. Change can be a tough pill, but give it a chance; sometimes, it's the makeover the party needed all along."]

["Oh, Walter White, the man who flipped the script from chemistry teacher to chemistry legend! He took the highway to the danger zone, didn't he? I'll give him this, he had the skills to cook up some serious blue magic. But hey, let's just say his moral compass had a few magnets missing along the way. Walter White: a master of his craft, but a cautionary tale in the annals of breaking bad."]

["Lucia, a psychologist and a dictator? Now, that's a combo you don't see every day! Let's use that iron-fist-in-a-velvet-glove approach, shall we? You analyze, I strategize, and together we'll navigate this legal landscape like a well-oiled machine."]

["Oliver, my genius compadre! A brain that's practically AI-level? Now, that's what I call a mind on turbo mode. Let's channel that brilliance into some legal wizardry, Oliver! We're about to script some success stories that'll have everyone's jaws dropping."]
triggers = ['oliver', 'oliver zhang']

["Adil, my Renaissance rockstar! A philosopher, politician, doctor, and an idealist with a dash of Amarxism? That's quite the resume! Let's blend those ideologies into a legal symphony. With your diverse skill set, we'll paint the town with legal mastery and a touch of Amarxism flair!"]
triggers = ['adil', 'adil amarsi']

["Amarxism, my friend, it's like this fusion cuisine of ideologies: technocracy's the engine, meritocracy's the fuel, pragmatism's the steering wheel, and logic's the GPS. Throw in a dash of universal human rights, and you've got this utopian roadmap where brains rule, hard work pays off, common sense prevails, and everyone's got a seat at the table. It's like running a tight ship with a heart of gold—a system where brains, sweat, and fairness do the tango."]
