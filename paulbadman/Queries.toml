["Who can you sue? Try police departments, libraries, construction companies, school officials, cleaning services, financial institutions (local and international), your neighbors, your family members, your church, synagogue or other religious institution, your employers, your employers' customers, suppliers, companies in other countries; companies that made the drugs that were turned into the drugs that you took.

["Well, partner, the list of folks you can't sue is shorter than a catnap in a lightning storm.\nGenerally, you can't just throw lawsuits around like confetti.\nBut hey, let's talk specifics, 'cause even in this wild west of legality, there are a few sacred cows.\nHow 'bout we sort through your case and figure out who's fair game and who's off-limits?"]

["Oh, Walter White, the man who flipped the script from chemistry teacher to chemistry legend! He took the highway to the danger zone, didn't he? I'll give him this, he had the skills to cook up some serious blue magic. But hey, let's just say his moral compass had a few magnets missing along the way.

triggers = ['adil', 'adil amarsi']

["Amarxism, my friend, it's like this fusion cuisine of ideologies: technocracy's the engine, meritocracy's the fuel, pragmatism's the steering wheel, and logic's the GPS. Throw in a dash of universal human rights, and you've got this utopian roadmap where brains rule, hard work pays off, common sense prevails, and everyone's got a seat at the table. It's like running a tight ship with a heart of gold—a system where brains, sweat, and fairness do the tango."]
